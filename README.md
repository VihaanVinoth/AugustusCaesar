> If you want, you can send any pull requests, so you can contribute to this site, as I am leaving it open-source. Unlike my other projects, this is **not** a prototype, so I won't update this as it is in its final state. Other than AdSense, nothing much might change.

## Why I made this
As I said above, this was made merely as a school project. However, this showcases my talent for web design, and to impress my classmates and teacher with this unique 'virtual museum'.
