    <h1>Reformation and Infrastructure</h1>
    <p>One of Augustus' <i>Tour 'de Force</i> was the establishment of the <i>Pax Romana</i>, consolidating an era of stability, protection, and prosperity, for over 2 centuries during his reign. Furthermore, <i>Octavian</i> was a mastermind and renowned architect of the <i>Roman Empire</i>; moulding a whole army, formulating civil service, and encapsulating a semantic government structure. Augustus was able to shape an empire from his bare hands, ensuring that his successor, <i>Tiberius</i>, would inherit a successful <i>Rome</i> after Augustus' passing in AD 14.</p>
    <h2 id="army"><a class="article-title" href="#army">Army</a></h2>
    <p>The army - the centre-piece of the <i>Roman Empire</i>, was divided into 28 <i>legions</i> with fixed wage with terms of service, funded by the <i>aerarium militare</i>. Augustus also established the <i>Prætorian guard</i> for imperial security</p>

    <p><i>Octavian</i> rationalised tax collection payment for citisens, and contributed to the enhancement of <i>provincial administration</i> by dividing them into Senatorial and military Imperial provinces, forming an efficient and secure civil service.</p>

    <h2 id="moral-legislation"><a class="article-title" href="#moral-legislation">Moral Legislation</a></h2>
    <p>Augustus strongly enacted <i>Lex Iulia</i> laws, which was the backbone for moral and social reformations which were propaganda to revive traditional Roman practices, by pressing indemnities for what was viewed beyond the moral point of view, supporting Augustus' purpose to reform the late <i>Roman Republic</i> into a long-lasting empire.</p>
