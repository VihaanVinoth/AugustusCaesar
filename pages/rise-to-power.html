    <h1>Rise to Power</h1>
    <p>With <i>Mark Antony</i>, and <i>Marcus Aemilius Lepidus</i>, Augustus formed the <i>Second Triumvirate</i> to kill Caesar's assassins at the <i>Battle of Phillipi</i> (42 BC) in the Roman province of Macedonia, near present-day Kavala, Greece. However, the coalition dissolved in 32 BC, which entailed a civil war against <i>Mark Antony</i> and <i>Cleopatra VII of Egypt</i>, culminating the <i>Battle of Actium</i> in 31 BC. From a landslide, <i>Octavian</i> cemented his victory after the battle, which led to their opponents taking their own lives, which marked the de facto conclusion of the <i>Roman Republic</i>.</p>

    <p>Despite the collapse of the <i>Roman Republic</i>, Augustus was able to retain his power in the senate, and was granted sovereignty over Rome. Penultimately, he established the <i>Principate</i> as a scheme to manipulate authority into his hands, naming himself as the <i>princeps</i>. Additionally, he accrued <i>Tribunician</i> power - granting <i>Octavian</i> to propose legislation - and the <i>Greater Proconsular Command</i>, which allowed him to yield military control. Overall, these principles permitted Augustus to rule as Emperor, without claiming the title of King. </p>
